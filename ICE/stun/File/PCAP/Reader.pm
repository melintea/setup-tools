=head1 NAME

File::PCAP::Reader - read PCAP files with pure Perl

=head1 VERSION

Version v0.0.7

use version; our $VERSION = qv('v0.0.7');


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module reads PCAP files that are written with tcpdump.

    use File::PCAP::Reader;

    my $fpr = File::PCAP::Reader->new( $fname );

    my $gh = $fpr->global_header();

    my $tsec = $fpr->next_packet();

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new( $fname )

Open a PCAP file and read it's global header.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($self,$fname) = @_;
    my $type = ref($self) || $self;

    $self = bless {
        fname => $fname,
    }, $type;

    $self->_init();

    return $self;
} # new()

=head2 global_header()

Return a reference to a hash that contains the data of the global header of
the PCAP file.

This hash contains the following keys:

=over 4

=item magic_number

The magic number 0xa1b2c3d4 or 0xa1b23c4d for nanosecond-resolution files.

At the moment this version of the library does not handle files from
architectures with a different byte ordering.

=item version_major

The major version number.

=item version_minor

The minor version number.

=item thiszone

The GMT to local time correction.

=item sigfigs

The accuracy of the timestamps in the file.

=item snaplen

The maximum length of the captured packets in octets.

=item network

The data link type of the packets in this file.

=back

=cut

sub global_header {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{global_header};
} # global_header()

=head2 link_layer_header_type()

Returns either the link type name of the global header field I<network> or its numerical value.

=cut

sub link_layer_header_type {
    my $self = shift;
    my $llht = $self->{global_header}->{network};
    if ( defined $File::PCAP::linktypes->{$llht} ) {
        return $File::PCAP::linktypes->{$llht}->[1];
    }
    else {
        return $llht;
    }
} # link_layer_header_type()

=head2 next_packet()

Read the next datagram record in the PCAP file.

Returns a hash reference containing the data of the next packet
or nothing at the end of the PCAP file.

This hash contains the following keys

=over 4

=item I<< ts_sec >>

The date and time when this packet was captured.
This value is in seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.

=item I<< ts_usec >>

The microseconds when this packet was captured as an offset to I<< ts_sec >>.

=item I<< incl_len >>

The number of octets of packet data saved in the file.

=item I<< orig_len >>

The length of the packet as it appeared on the network when it was captured.

=item I<< buf >>

The actual packet data as a blob.
This buffer should contain at least I<< inc_len >> bytes.

=back

You may want to use it like this:

  while(my $np = $fpr->next_packet()) {
    # ... do something with $np
  }

=cut

sub next_packet {
    my ($self) = @_;

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item  Need a filename to read PCAP data from

You need to specify a filename with the constructor.

=item Can't open file '$fname' for reading

The file you specified with C<< $fname >> is not readable.

=item Don't know how to handle file with magic number 0xaabbccdd

The magic number in the first 4 bytes of a PCAP file is 0xa1b2c3d4.
This number is used to detect the file format itself and the byte ordering.

At the moment this module just handles PCAP files with the same byte order as the computer this program is running on.

=item Can't handle file version $vmajor.$vminor

At the moment this module just handles PCAP file version 2.4.

=item Can't read packet data from file '$!'

There was a problem reading the packet data from the file.

=item Reached EOF before reading packet header!

The file reached EOF while trying to read the last packet header.

This may be a hint to a shortened file.

=item Reached EOF before reading packet buffer!

The file reached EOF while trying to read the last packet buffer.

This may be a hint to a shortened file.
