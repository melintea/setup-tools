File::PCAP::ACAP2PCAP - convert ASA capture to PCAP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module converts Cisco ASA packet capture outputs to PCAP files.

    use File::PCAP::ACAP2PCAP;

    my $a2p = File::PCAP::ACAP2PCAP->new( $args );

    $a2p->parse(\*STDIN);

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new( $args )

Creates a new object, takes a hash reference as argument with
the following keys:

 my $a2p = File::PCAP::ACAP2PCAP( {
     dlt    => $dlt,                # data link type, see below
     output => $fname,              # filename for PCAP output
 } );

The data link type is put in the PCAP global header.
It defaults to 1 (Ethernet).
There are some versions of Cisco software that output raw IP headers.
For these use 101 (Raw IP) and for more information on data link types, see
L<http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html>.

=head2 parse( $fd )

This function does the parsing of the ASA output from an IO stream.

To parse STDIN, you would do something like the following:

  $a2p->parse(\*STDIN);

To parse a file given by name, you open it and take the file handle:

  if (open(my $input,'<',$filename)) {
    $a2p->parse($input);
    close $input;
  }

To write the packets into the PCAP file this function uses
L<< File::PCAP::Writer->packet()|File::PCAP::Writer >>.
