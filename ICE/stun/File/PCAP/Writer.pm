File::PCAP::Writer - write PCAP files with pure Perl

=head1 VERSION

Version v0.0.7

use version; our $VERSION = qv('v0.0.7');


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module writes PCAP files that can be read with tcpdump or wireshark.

    use File::PCAP::Writer;

    my $fpw = File::PCAP::Writer->new( {
        fname => 'file.pcap',
        dlt => 1,
    } );

    $fpw->packet( $tsec, $usec, $blen, $plen, $buf );

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new( $args )

Create a new File::PCAP::Writer object.

Parameter I<< $args >> is a reference to a hash, that may contain the
following keys:

=over 4

=item fname

The corresponding value is the name of the PCAP file.
It defaults to C<< file.pcap >> if the key is omitted.

The file is created and filled with a global PCAP header.
It can be immediately read by tcpdump.

=item dlt

The corresponding value is the data link type that is written in the global
PCAP header.
It defaults to 1 (LINKTYPE_ETHERNET) if the key is omitted.

See L<< http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html >> for more information about
link-layer header type values.

Note that this is only a hint for tcpdump or wireshark at the type
of packets to expect in the PCAP file.
You are responsible to add datagram packets that match the link-layer header
type in the global PCAP header.

sub new {
    my ($self,$args) = @_;
    my $type = ref($self) || $self;

    my $fname = $args->{fname} || "file.pcap";
    my $dlt   = $args->{dlt}   || 1;

    $self = bless {
        fname => $fname,
        dlt   => $dlt,
    }, $type;

    $self->_init();

    return $self;
} # new()

=head2 packet( $tsec, $usec, $blen, $plen, $buf )

Write a new datagram record at the end of the PCAP file.

The arguments are:

=over 4

=item I<< $tsec >>

The date and time for this packets.
This value is in seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.

=item I<< $usec >>

The microseconds when this packet was captured as an offset to I<< $tsec >>.

=item I<< $blen >>

The number of bytes of the packet data saved in the file.

=item I<< $plen >>

The length of the packet as it appeared on the network.

=item I<< $buf >>

The actual packet data as a blob.
This buffer should contain at least I<< $blen >> bytes.

Note that this packet data should match the link-layer type in the global
PCAP header.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Can't write global header to file '$fname'

The program can't write to file I<< $fname >>.
This is the name of the file for the PCAP data.
If I<< $fname >> is C<< file.pcap >> than you probably have
not specified a file name explicitely.

This message appears at the time when the File::PCAP::Writer object
is created. It often hints at problems with file permissions.

=item Can't write packet data to file '$fname'

The program can't write to file I<< $fname >>.
This is the name of the file for the PCAP data.
If I<< $fname >> is C<< file.pcap >> than you probably have
not specified a file name explicitely.

This message appears when new packet data shall be written.
It often hints at problems with a lack of disk space.

=item  Need a filename to write PCAP data

Since there is a default value for the filename,
you probably have it overwritten with an empty filename
when calling C<< new() >>.
